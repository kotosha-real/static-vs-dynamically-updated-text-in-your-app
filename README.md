Here's the repo for the article "Static vs. Dynamically Updated Text In Your App" on Medium.

It covers static and dynamic approaches to working with text in your app. You can navigate through the commits to move between the initial commit with the default vite-react-ssr app and the fully composed dynamic approach.

There are also two StackBlitz projects with both approaches: [static](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-react-intl-static-texts) and [dynamic](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-react-intl-dynamic-texts).

Have fun!
